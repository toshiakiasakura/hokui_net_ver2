# New version of hokui.net

Our aim is to construct simple website. 
Follow the rule of KISS! 

The site is now accessible via http://ik1-419-41929.vs.sakura.ne.jp/


## Development environment.
- You should run two server for server side and front end side.   
In this project, port number 3000 and 3001 is distributed   
to server and front side, respectively.   
```
node index.js  
```
- another terminal,   
```
cd client 
yarn start 
```
then you can interactively GET and POSt , etc... processes.
